  <h2>About</h2>
<p>
  Independent prescribing services based in York, supporting aesthetic
  practice. I work in collaboration with aesthetic practitioners to
  provide prescribing following appropriate consultation and holistic
  clinical assessment.
</p>

<p>
  Patient safety and individual need are central to all prescribing
  decisions. Assessments consider the wider health, wellbeing, and
  circumstances of the individual, ensuring prescribing is appropriate
  and within scope of professional practice. All prescribing is
  undertaken in line with legal, ethical, and professional standards.
